# Tello Drone Python & Jupyter Notebooks üöÅüêçüìì
This repository provides various Python and Jupyter Notebook examples of how to code Tello drones using Python. These coding examples were created by Frederick Feraco and are utilized in the "Science of Drones" course, teaching science research students at Walt WHitman HS and students at Five Towns College üè´üéì.

This repository provides various approaches to program DJI's Tello drone using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Whether you are using pure Python scripts or leveraging the interactive capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks, you'll find valuable examples and methods to get the most out of your Tello drone programming experience.

## Overview

Tello drones are not only fun to fly but also come with a robust programming interface that allows developers, students, and hobbyists to explore various aspects of drone technology. The examples provided in this repository range from basic flight commands to complex missions, like capturing a 360-degree panorama. Furthermore, these missions are accomplished by utilizing the extensive list of commands provided by Tello's SDK, which allows programmers to control the drone‚Äôs movement, camera, and retrieve real-time data about its state.

## Command Reference Table

Understanding the commands available in the Tello SDK is essential for effective drone programming. Below is a markdown table which provides a brief explanation, the actual code command, an example of how it might be used, and an explanation of the example for various SDK commands.
